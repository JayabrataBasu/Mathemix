# GitHub Issue: Add 50 Advanced Statistical Methodologies to MatheMixX

## Issue Title
**Feature Request: Implement 50 Advanced Statistical Methodologies and Analyses**

## Issue Body

### Description
MatheMixX currently provides a solid foundation for time series analysis, regression, and basic visualization. To expand its capabilities and make it a comprehensive statistical analysis platform, we need to add 50 advanced statistical methodologies. This will significantly enhance its value for data scientists, researchers, and analysts.

### Proposed Features
Below is a curated list of 50 statistical methodologies, grouped by category. Each includes a brief description and rationale for integration. Implementation should prioritize feasibility, user interface integration, and performance (leveraging existing Rust bindings where possible).

3. **VAR (Vector Autoregression)** - Multivariate time series model for analyzing interdependencies between multiple variables.
4. **Cointegration Tests (e.g., Johansen Test)** - Tests for long-run equilibrium relationships between non-stationary time series.

18. **Ridge/Lasso Regression** - Regularized regression to handle multicollinearity and overfitting.
19. **Bayesian Regression** - Probabilistic regression with prior distributions for uncertainty quantification.
20. **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** - Extends linear regression to non-normal responses (e.g., Poisson, binomial).
21. **Mixed Effects Models (Multilevel Models)** - Accounts for hierarchical or grouped data structures.
22. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)** - Finds linear relationships between two sets of variables.
23. **Factor Analysis** - Identifies underlying latent factors in multivariate data.
24. **Discriminant Analysis** - Classifies observations into predefined groups.
25. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** - Tests for significant differences between group means.
26. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** - Dimensionality reduction for correlated variables.
27. **Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox Models)** - Analyzes time-to-event data with censoring.
28. **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)** - (Duplicate - see 22) Wait, adjust: **Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)** - Extends ANOVA to multiple dependent variables.
29. **Correspondence Analysis** - Analyzes contingency tables for categorical data relationships.
30. **Cluster Analysis (e.g., K-Means)** - Unsupervised grouping of data points.

#### Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling (10 methods)
31. **Decision Trees** - Tree-based models for interpretable classification and regression.
32. **Random Forests** - Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
33. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** - Classification and regression for complex boundaries.
34. **Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM for Time Series)** - Deep learning for sequential data and non-linear patterns.
35. **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)** - Ensemble learning for high-accuracy predictions.
36. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** - Instance-based learning for pattern recognition.
37. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier for fast categorical predictions.
38. **Time Series Cross-Validation** - Model evaluation using rolling or expanding windows.
39. **Bootstrap Resampling** - Non-parametric method for estimating sampling distributions.
40. **Monte Carlo Simulation** - Random sampling for uncertainty analysis and risk assessment.

#### Hypothesis Testing & Diagnostics (10 methods)
41. **t-Tests and F-Tests** - Basic hypothesis testing for means and variances.
42. **Mann-Whitney U Test** - Non-parametric test for two independent samples.
43. **Kruskal-Wallis Test** - Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA for multiple groups.
44. **Chi-Square Tests (Goodness-of-Fit, Independence)** - Tests for categorical data distributions.
45. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test** - Compares empirical distributions.
46. **Shapiro-Wilk Test** - Tests for normality in small samples.
47. **Levene's Test** - Tests for equal variances across groups.
48. **Durbin-Watson Test** - Detects autocorrelation in regression residuals.
49. **Breusch-Pagan Test** - Tests for heteroscedasticity in regression.
50. **White Test** - Robust heteroscedasticity test for complex variance patterns.

### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1 (High Priority):** Time Series (1-15) - Build on existing forecasting capabilities.
- **Phase 2:** Regression & Multivariate (16-30) - Extend linear regression features.
- **Phase 3:** Machine Learning (31-40) - Introduce predictive modeling.
- **Phase 4:** Diagnostics (41-50) - Enhance hypothesis testing and model validation.
- **Technical Approach:** Use Python libraries (statsmodels, scikit-learn) with Rust acceleration for performance. Integrate into PyQt UI with new tabs/widgets.
- **Testing:** Create comprehensive test suites similar to existing time series tests.
- **Documentation:** Update user guides and add examples for each method.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Each method implemented with UI integration, validation, and error handling.
- Comprehensive tests passing (similar to current 172/172 success rate).
- Performance benchmarks ensuring desktop usability.
- Backward compatibility maintained.

### Additional Context
This expansion will transform MatheMixX from a specialized time series tool into a full statistical platform, appealing to broader audiences in academia, finance, and industry. Prioritize methods with high user demand and low implementation complexity.
