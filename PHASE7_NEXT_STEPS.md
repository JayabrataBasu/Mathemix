# Phase 7 Time Series Analysis - Next Steps

## Current Situation

✅ **All code is complete and ready**
- Rust core: 20/20 tests passing
- Python bindings: 27 functions implemented
- Python API: TimeSeriesAnalyzer class + functional API
- Plotting: 5 plotting functions
- Desktop UI: Complete time series widget
- Tests: 36 comprehensive tests
- Documentation: 450-line user guide

⚠️ **Package needs reinstallation**
- The compiled library is ready at: `target/release/mathemixx_core.dll`
- It needs to be installed to the Python environment

## Quick Start (After Python Restart)

### Step 1: Reinstall the Package

```bash
cd /c/Users/jayab/Mathemix

# Close all Python/VS Code processes first, then:
pip uninstall mathemixx-core -y
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
python test_phase7_bindings.py
```

You should see all ✓ (green checkmarks) for all 27 functions.

### Step 3: Run Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_phase7_timeseries.py -v
```

Expected: 36 tests passing

### Step 4: Launch Desktop UI

```bash
python run_desktop.py
```

Then:
1. File → Open CSV (load a dataset with time series data)
2. Click the "Time Series" tab
3. Select a numeric column from the list
4. Try the features:
   - Plot ACF/PACF
   - Run stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS)
   - Decompose (set period to your seasonal cycle, e.g., 12 for monthly)
   - Forecast (choose method, set parameters, generate forecast)

## File Locations

- **User Guide:** `desktop_docs/PHASE7_TIMESERIES_GUIDE.md`
- **Implementation Status:** `desktop_docs/PHASE7_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **Tests:** `tests/test_phase7_timeseries.py`
- **Python API:** `python/timeseries.py`
- **Plots:** `python/plots.py` (search for "Phase 7")
- **Desktop Widget:** `python/mathemixx_desktop/timeseries_widget.py`

## Features Available

### Basic Operations
- Lag, Difference, Moving Averages (SMA/EMA/WMA), Rolling Statistics

### Autocorrelation
- ACF, PACF plots with confidence bands
- Ljung-Box test for randomness

### Stationarity
- ADF Test (tests for unit root)
- KPSS Test (tests for stationarity)
- Both tests together with interpretation

### Decomposition
- Seasonal decomposition (additive/multiplicative)
- 4-panel plot (Observed, Trend, Seasonal, Residual)

### Forecasting
- Simple Exponential Smoothing (level only)
- Holt Linear (level + trend)
- Holt-Winters (level + trend + seasonality)
- All with confidence intervals

## Example Usage

```python
from python.timeseries import TimeSeriesAnalyzer

# Load your data
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('sales.csv')['monthly_sales'].tolist()

# Create analyzer
ts = TimeSeriesAnalyzer(data)

# Check stationarity
adf_result = ts.adf_test()
print(f"Is stationary: {adf_result.is_stationary}")

# Decompose
decomp = ts.decompose(period=12, model='additive')

# Forecast
forecast = ts.forecast_holt_winters(
    alpha=0.3, beta=0.1, gamma=0.2, 
    period=12, horizon=12
)
print(f"Next 12 months: {forecast.forecasts}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Module has no attribute 'py_lag'"
→ Package not reinstalled yet. Follow Step 1 above.

### "ImportError: cannot import name 'rolling_mean'"
→ Tests need updating. Use `mathemixx_core.py_rolling_mean` directly.

### "Forecasting failed"
→ Check you have enough data (at least 2 seasonal cycles for Holt-Winters)

### "Decomposition failed"  
→ Verify period setting matches your data (12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly, 7 for daily)

## Documentation

See `desktop_docs/PHASE7_TIMESERIES_GUIDE.md` for:
- Complete feature documentation
- Interpretation guides (how to read ACF/PACF plots)
- Stationarity test decision matrix
- Forecasting method selection
- 3 practical examples
- Best practices

## What's Next

After installation works:
1. Test with real time series data (sales, weather, stock prices, etc.)
2. Verify all plots render correctly
3. Test forecast accuracy on historical data
4. Add more examples to documentation if needed
5. Consider Phase 8 features (ARIMA? State space models?)
